public class First{     // Name of the class is first 
    public static void main(String args[])  //This is the name of the function
    {
   System.out.println("This is the first program for java");    //System.out.println is used to print something // just like printf or cout in C and C++
}
}
// Here print and println are different means if u write println it will print the new line as well and give the output 
// and only print will not give any new line so that means you can also write print only
// void means yeh function call hone ke baad koi bhi value return nhi krta hai 
// For giving the name of the classes in JAVA  we use PascalConventions
// For giving the name of the functiosn in JAVA we use camelCaseConventions

// AddTwoNumber --> This is pascal naming convention
// addTwoNumber --> This is camel case convention

// In the above syntax static and void are reserved keywords which are reserved by JAVA
